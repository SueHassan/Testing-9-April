# Read me first!

An RM will create this issue once a staging deploy is completed,
please use the "RC1 QA Task" template if the deployed version was the first release candidate of
a new major version.

An RM should create the ["Changes tested" task list](#changes-tested) to mention the maintainers responsible for each commit since the last release so they can delegate testing.

You can use the following oneliner to get started, but you will need to mention the maintainers manually until there is a tool for this. ```git log PREVIOUS_TAG-ee..LATEST_TAG-ee --pretty=format:"- [ ] [%h](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/commit/%h) @%aN \`%s\`"```

The [deadline](#deadline) should be set to **12** hours after the completion of the deploy.

`RELEASE_VERSION` can be an RC as well. eg. `10.4.0.rc1`, `10.4.0`, `10.4.1`.

Set the issue title to: `YYYY-MM-DD: RELEASE_VERSION QA task`

**Set the issue as confidential if this is a security release**

Please remove this notice before posting.
